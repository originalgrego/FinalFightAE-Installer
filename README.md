# FinalFightAE-Installer
Final Fight Anniversary Edition Installer

Requirements:

 * Windows
 * Java

**************** WARNING! **************** 

This installer only works with split mame roms, do not use a merged rom or you will have a bad time.

The installer should be placed in the root of a drive, ex C:\FinalFightAE-Installer

Put the ffight.zip in the same directory as the installer.

**************** WARNING! **************** 

To Install:

	1.) Double click ffae_installer.jar
	2.) Click the "Select Zip" button
	3.) Navigate to your rom folder and select "ffight.zip" aka "Final Fight (World, set 1)" according to mame
	4.) Click the "Patch" button, a prompt should tell you if it was successful or not, if it was successful you should have a "ffightae.zip" in your rom folder now

If it was not successful it was likely due to file system permissions or invalid CRCs on your rom, please make sure you have access to your rom folder and the folder the installer is in and check that you have the right rom.

Final Fight AE is supported by HBMame, Mame 2003-Plus, Final Burn Neo and Mister.  A .mra file has been included for mister users.
